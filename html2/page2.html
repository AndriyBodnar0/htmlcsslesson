        Manfred, known more commonly as Manny, is the main protagonist of Ice Age, Ice Age: The Meltdown, Ice Age:
        Continental Drift and Ice Age: Collision Course, and the tritagonist of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs. He is a
        mammoth that led a herd of different animals brought together after various adventures and experiences. In the
        first film, he was sour, cranky, ill-tempered, wrathful, grouchy, sarcastic, grumpy, surly, angry and stubborn,
        but at the end, he becomes kind, selfless, heroic, kind-hearted, nice and sweet. Once a devoted father and
        husband, Manfred loved his wife and child dearly, protecting them well until a band of humans on the hunt came
        between them. Manny attempted to fend them off but was unsuccessful as his wife and child were killed. This left
        Manny embittered with the world at large, being cold and indifferent towards other creatures.

    <p>
        A no-nonsense, reserved mammoth, Manny had little patience for many creatures and could often be harsh, rude and
        inconsiderate, but this made way for a more compassionate disposition and was often curbed by a strong love for
        his family and a powerful dedication towards those he was close to.
        Early Life


        At some point in his youth, Manfred celebrated the holiday Christmas with his family, making use of the family
        Christmas Rock, which had been in their family for generations, as a beacon to Santa Claus.

        In his adult years, Manfred was a father and husband to a female mammoth and mammoth calf, both of which he
        loved dearly. One day, however, a group of humans on the hunt found the three of them and Manfred staved them
        off as best he could, keeping a number of them at bay before a number of the humans surrounded him so that
        others killed his wife and child as all he could do was call out in horror. This incident left Manfred sour and
        indifferent to the rest of the world and made it so that he did not attempt to become close to anyone after
        that.

        Finding the Baby

        "I'm still trying to get rid of the last thing I saved."
        â€•Manny to Sid on not wanting to return the baby.

        Manny walks with Sid through a forest.

        Manny and Sid continued to wander up north through a forest, wherein Sid continued to bore Manny with more talk
        of his own life, and how he attempted to try a mating dance on more than one mate. Manny chided Sid, informing
        him that if one gained a mate, he or she should be loyal, or in Sid's case, grateful: with that, Manny called
        for Sid to leave him alone. At that moment, Manny had stopped walking as he reached a creek, where he stood
        still, unaware that Sid had bumped into him. Manny stood and watched as a human woman lay in the waters, holding
        a baby. Weakened greatly, the woman held onto a log with her other arm, pulling herself closer to Manny. With
        that, she pushed her baby towards the mammoth, who kept it from slipping into the river. The woman looked up at
        Manny, who stared back as she slipped away into unconsciousness. Manny pulled the baby closer and saw that it
        was alive and well. Both Manny and Sid looked up to find that the woman had disappeared and Manny indifferently
        walked off, leaving the baby behind.
