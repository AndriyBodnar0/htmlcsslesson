        Sidney, known more commonly as Sid, is a ground sloth who was part of a herd of different animals after a number
        of adventures and experiences brought them all together. He is the tritagonist of Ice Age and Ice Age: The
        Meltdown, the main protagonist of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, a major character in Ice Age: Continental
        Drift and the tetartagonist of Ice Age: Collision Course.

        Born into a family of sloths that went on to abandon him well into his adulthood, Sid met a mammoth named Manny
        and a saber-tooth tiger named Diego as the three of them made a journey through a tundra to return a human baby
        named Roshan to his tribe. Following the journey, the three animals remained the best of friends, forming their
        own "Herd".

        A lazy, slovenly ground sloth, Sid was not the most perceptive creature to live in the ice age, but made up for
        his shortcomings with loyalty to those he cared about. Sid's joining a herd of animals shaped his life for years
        ahead, becoming more considerate and thoughtful of others.
        Early Life

        "My mother always told me that bad news is just good news in disguise.
        Was this before she abandoned you?
        Ah, yes it was."
        ―Sid to Diego on the impact of his mother's ideals.

        Sid, as a youth, was left behind a number of times by his family during the migrations south for the winter,
        their attempts at leaving him behind becoming more and more elaborate. During one such leaving, Sid's mother
        Eunice told him that "bad news is just good news in disguise", but despite this, Sid's family still wanted him
        gone, leaving him behind one year in a cave, tied up and gagged with a field mouse, walking through water so
        that he would lose their scent. The next year, however, Sid found his family and regrouped with them, only to
        lose them for good during the annual migration.

    <p>Finding the Baby

        "Here's your little bundle of joy. We're returning it to the humans.
        The big, bad tigey-wigey gets left behind. Poor tigey-wigey.
        Sid, tigey-wigey is gonna lead the way."
        ―Manny and Sid prepare to leave to find the humans.[src]

        The next morning, Sid and Manny still continued walking on through trees, Sid eating an apple and relating to
        Manny about how he preferred not to mate for life: Manny remarked that if Sid ever found a mate he should be
        loyal and more importantly grateful. Throwing the apple aside, Sid remarked that mating for life was pointless
        and as he said more, he bumped into Manny, who had stopped walking and was staring at a human woman who lay
        exhausted in a creek. The human woman, though weakened, managed to push a small bundle towards Manny, which he
        saw to be a human baby. Sid remarked that the baby was all right but then saw that his mother, after having been
        in the creek, disappeared. Manny walked off, leaving the baby behind, which Sid contested, saying that they
        couldn’t simply leave the baby alone and that there was smoke up a nearby hill and that the baby’s “herd” must
        be up the hill, where Sid and Manny must return him. Manny, on the other hand, was not interested in helping Sid
        with anything: Sid, bothered at this, decided to return the baby alone, scaling the cliff wall to reach the
        human camp.
