        <p class=justify20>Scrat was an acorn- obsessed saber-toothed squirrel that lived during the ice ages, attempting to store his prized
            acorn. He is a supporting character in Ice Age, Ice Age: The Meltdown, and Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, and a
            major character in Ice Age: Continental Drift and Ice Age: Collision Course. As of 2013, he became the mascot of
            Blue Sky Studios, a subsidiary of 20th Century Fox (Now owned by Disney).</p>
            
        <p> During the days of the ice age, Scrat took an acorn with him everywhere, hoping to find a place to store it for
            the winter. Scrat also went out looking for other acorns so as to further his storage, looking all over for
            acorns and nuts</p>.
        <h2 id="Biography">Biography</h2>
        <p>A hapless saber-tooth squirrel, Scrat underwent a number of odd experiences through his life, all while trying to
                store a single acorn to make it through the ice age. Scrat was protective of his acorn to the point in which he
            would gladly risk his own life to keep it safe from others or from harm. </p>
        <h2 class="heading-2" id="adventures">adventures</h2>
        <p>Scrat was out in the frozen mountain ranges up north, looking for a place to store his acorn. Hopping this way
            and that, Scrat scampered through a patch of dried grass and wandered through the icy fields and patches of snow
            in the search for a place to bury his acorn for the winter. In a moment, Scrat found an ideal place and pressed
            his acorn into the ground. The acorn, however, would not go in easily, so Scrat began stomping on it, eventually
            sinking it into the ground. This resulted in a large crack forming, which traversed up the mountain glaciers and
            through much of the ice walls of the mountains, where the crack finally stopped and broke off a massive glacier.
